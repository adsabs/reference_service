# pystruct assumes that all trainning and testing samples have the same shape, the same number of nodes and states
# /python/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pystruct/models/graph_crf.py, line 198
# assuming the same number of nodes (features) is reasonable, however for NLP number of states (sentence length) varies
# from sample to sample, but this is in graph_crf which they have suggested to use for NLP
# TODO: should drive from graph_crf, implement joint_feature function to properly consider various length sentences
# for now do as they have done in their sample example, define static fold
# if the first training and testing sample is one of the longest references it would work
# hence the following static division of training and test works and shall be used for now
# instead of random number generator that usually is used in dividing train and test sample in ML
